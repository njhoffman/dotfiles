== Screen Configuration Notes ==
  * .xinitrc => i3 => polybar/shell/conky
  * on .xinitrc load configuration loaded by matching priority:
    * hostname - edids
    * edids
    * default (by resolution)
  * monitor outputs names must be matched to EDIDs in configuration
  * configuration will specify for monitors:
      * is primary monitor?
      * resolution
      * relative position (left-of, right-of)
      * absolute position (--pos 3840x700)
      * --dpi
      * --scale
  * monitors will have their own:
    * polybar config
    * shell font sizes, shell theme config, tmux config?
    * conky config
    * i3 scratchpad window sizes/positions depending on active monitor
      * must keep track of scratchpad current monitor and size
      * if opened on monitor with different resolution resize, otherwise keep saved size unless hotkey used
      * make compatible with 'move to edge' commands
  * each configuration should load values from environment variables and contain default values
